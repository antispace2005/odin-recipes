<h2 class = "subtitle">Steps</h2>
<ol class="steps-content">
    <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; add fettuccine and olive oil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>    
    <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet over low heat. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and dark. Stir in stock, white wine, garlic, Italian seasoning, and salt. Increase heat to medium and cook, stirring constantly, for about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to low and stir in sour cream until smooth. Stir in cornstarch and simmer until thickened, about 1 minute. Stir in fettuccine or spoon sauce over servings of pasta. Top with Parmesan cheese.</li>
